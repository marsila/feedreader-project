# FeedReader testing project by Rasha Ali

This is my feedReader testing project. It is part of the front-end web developer Nano-degree program.

# The project covers the following test cases:

1. Loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. A test suite named `"The menu"` which will cover:Ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
4. `"The menu"` will also ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
5. A test suite named `"Initial Entries"` which ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
6. A test suite named `"New Feed Selection" which ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
